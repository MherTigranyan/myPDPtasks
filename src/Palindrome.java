//You need to write a simple Java program to check if a given String is palindrome or not.
// A Palindrome is a String which is equal to the reverse of itself
// e.g. "Bob" is a palindrome because of the reverse of "Bob" is also "Bob"

public class Palindrome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
